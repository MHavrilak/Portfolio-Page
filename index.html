            Web Developement project! My name is Mike Havrilak and this page is the first step in my introduction into the wonderful world of coding!
        I am a born and bred Baltimore fan. Born and raised here, I am currently seeking a position with a local software
    developement company. After this six month bootcamp course is completed I will be proficient in front end and back end
web developement.</p>
            <p>I currently reside in Lutherville, MD with my wife and four year old daughter. I enjoy spending as much time wtih her as humanely possible as she is the 
                light of my life. I am looking forward to teaching her the value of hard work and that that hard work and dedication to achievement will allow
                anyone to reach the stars!
            </p>
            <p> I hope you enjoy viewing my first webpage. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Feel free to shoot me an email to talk about any career opportunities!

                All the Best,

                Mike
